# Succorer

A periodic reminder app. Built using [Quasar](https://quasar.dev).

## Installation

### MacOS
 - Download and run the app file.

### Other OSes
This project is largely for my own wants/desires right now. If you find it useful and aren't a Mac user, please let me know and I'll look more into setting up some build environments to release the Windows/Linux pre-built packages as well.

### From source

#### Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

### Build the app for production
Requires Quasar CLI to be installed: https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation
```bash
quasar build -m electron
```

## Development

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev -m electron
```

### Lint the files
```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
